# Checkpoint Wild Circus

Hello wilder, 

Take a brief moment to come back five months ago. You started the adventure with a tiny simple Wild Circus, in static HTML/CSS.
 
It is soon the end of the journey. You have grown up in many domains. It is now time to show us the incredible progress you have made during the training and all the good practice you have learned. 

In order to close the loop, we invite you to create the site of Wild Circus. Yes, again ! But a dynamic site this time, editable, with many options and a beautiful responsive design, using all langages, tools and technics you have discovered.

This Wild Circus v2 should contains a visitor area and an administration area. You should be able to dynamically manage these informations :
 
- Performers 
    Name, picture, short biography. You can create as many performers as you wish.
    
- Performances
    Description, picture, performer... 
    Bonus : a performance could involve many performers. 
    
- About Us
    Describe the circus, its history. 
    This should be an editable text, with pictures if possible.
    
- Other informations
    - Prices
       Dynamic, for different kind of visitors (adult, child, group...) and 2 periods (week-end, other days). It should be possible to add new type of visitor. (e.g displayed in a table).
    - Date and location of our next shows (e.g. displayed on a map)
    
- Contact form
    Send a mail to the wild circus administrator
    
Bonus : manage an authentication for the admin area

Texts, pictures, graphical design are at your convenience. Just remember the theme : CIRCUS ! It could be a one page or multiple page. 

You are also free to add other features (if you have time), make us dream !

Good luck !
